# SiriTax
My findings / code in attempt to make the siricoin more fair with tax

# Tax levels
Implimenting levels of tax and redistributing to lower hashrate miners (AVRs) would improve the fairness of the network and would help AVRs actually make Siri in one way or another. <br>

## AVRs, ESPs and very weak computers
300KH/s or less: 0% <br>
300-1000KH/s: 2.5% <br>
1-3MH/s: 2.6% <br>

## Low-Mid range CPUs or Weak IGPUs (Intel HD Graphics)
3-5MH/s: 2.7% <br>
5-7MH/s: 2.8% <br>
7-10MH/s: 3% <br>

## Mid-High range CPUs or older/weaker dedicated GPUs (GTX 9 Series)
10-30MH/s: 4% <br>
30-50MH/s: 4.5% <br>
50-100MH/s: 4.75% <br>
100-120MH/s: 5% <br>

## Mid-High range GPUs (GTX 10 Series)
120-200MH/s: 7% <br>
200-400MH/s: 9% <br>
400-600MH/s: 11% <br>
600-700MH/s: 13% <br>

# High End Flagship GPUs (RTX 20, 30 Series)
700-800MH/s: 15% <br>
800-900MH/s: 17% <br>
900-1000MH/s: 19% <br>
1GH+: 20% <br>
